# Exidy Sorcerer Schematics

Digitization into KiCad of the Exidy Sorcerer schematics from the March ’97 Sorcerer Technical Manual. Created for my own personal use, schematics may contain errors.

Custom symbols and footprints created for these schematics are in [my KiCad libraries](https://github.com/89Mods/kicad-library).

Contributions welcome.
